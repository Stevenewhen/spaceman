# Next Steps

- I would like to add replayability to the game that would +1 to lives once a correct letter is input
- Add in an option that will cost the player 2 lives if they click on the HINT button.
- A modal asking player if they are sure they would like to use lives in order to reveal hint.
- A start and finish element that once a player correct geusses the word the ship would be once step closer to the goal.
- Sound would be a good add-on for the count down starting from life 5.
- On an incorrect guess the window would shake.
- Make the entire game window fit on any device size.
- Show hidden word after the player loses.
